# Connect Four
A Connect Four commandline game made in Ruby.

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four).

## Instructions
To play, clone this repo and run the following from the root folder:

`ruby ./main.rb`

## Afterword
This project was done to practice Test Driven Development (TDD) and get experience with Ruby Testing with RSpec.

To see my tests, run `rspec` from the repo's root folder, and feel free to inspect my spec files in `./spec`.

I quite enjoyed the TDD method, as it kept me focused on what the program's methods *should* do before actually writing them. Having test cases in mind (and written) before actually writing code in my programs lightened the testing load later, and prevented me from missing edge cases. I understand the benefit of TDD now, as writing tests before/while writing code *seems* like it takes more time, but in reality it can lead to more precise code and can actually save a lot of time towards the end of a project.

From now on I will consider implementing TDD in my everyday development, especially for larger projects that require lots of care.
